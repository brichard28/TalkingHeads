    Keyboard Device tests. Starts iohub server, runs test set, then
    stops iohub server.

    Since there is no way to currently automate keyboard event generation in
    a way that would actually test the iohub keyboard event processing logic,
    each test simply calls one of the device methods / properties and checks
    that the return type is as expected.

    Each method is called with no args; that should be improved.

    Following methods are not yet tested:
            addFilter
            enableFilters
            getConfiguration
            getCurrentDeviceState
            getModifierState
