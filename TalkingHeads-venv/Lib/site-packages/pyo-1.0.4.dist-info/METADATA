pyo is a Python module containing classes for a wide variety of audio signal processing types. 
With pyo, user will be able to include signal processing chains directly in Python scripts or 
projects, and to manipulate them in real time through the interpreter. Tools in pyo module offer 
primitives, like mathematical operations on audio signal, basic signal processing (filters, 
delays, synthesis generators, etc.), but also complex algorithms to create sound granulation 
and others creative audio manipulations. pyo supports OSC protocol (Open Sound Control), to ease 
communications between softwares, and MIDI protocol, for generating sound events and controlling 
process parameters. pyo allows creation of sophisticated signal processing chains with all the 
benefits of a mature, and widely used, general programming language.
